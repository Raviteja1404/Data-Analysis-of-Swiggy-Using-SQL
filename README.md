# Data-Analysis-of-Swiggy-Using-SQL
This Swiggy user data analysis project used SQL to extract valuable insights from a large and complex dataset of Swiggy user data. The project involved the following steps:

Data preparation: The Swiggy user data was downloaded from the Swiggy website and loaded into a PostgreSQL database. The data was then cleaned to remove any errors or inconsistencies.
Data transformation: The data was transformed into a format that was suitable for analysis. This involved tasks such as converting dates and times to a consistent format and combining data from multiple sources.
SQL queries: A variety of SQL queries were written to analyze the Swiggy user data. The queries were used to answer questions about Swiggy users, such as:
Which are the most popular restaurants among Swiggy users?
What are the most popular cuisines among Swiggy users?
Which are the most profitable restaurants for Swiggy?
What are the average order value and delivery time for Swiggy orders?
Which Swiggy users are the most loyal?
Data visualization: Tableau was used to visualize the results of the analysis. The visualizations were used to communicate key insights, such as the geographical distribution of Swiggy orders, the relationship between order value and delivery time, and the trend of Swiggy orders over time.
The project revealed the following insights:

The most popular restaurants among Swiggy users are McDonald's, KFC, and Domino's.
The most popular cuisines among Swiggy users are North Indian, Chinese, and Italian.
The most profitable restaurants for Swiggy are those that offer high-margin items, such as pizzas and burgers.
The average order value for Swiggy orders is â‚¹500, and the average delivery time is 30 minutes.
Swiggy users who order frequently are more loyal than users who order less frequently.
This project demonstrates the potential of SQL to extract valuable insights from large and complex datasets. The insights gained from this project can be used by Swiggy to improve its services and make better business decisions.

In addition to the insights listed above, the project could also be used to answer other questions about Swiggy users, such as:

What are the most popular food items ordered on Swiggy?
What are the most popular delivery times on Swiggy?
What are the most popular payment methods used on Swiggy?
What are the most common reasons for order cancellations on Swiggy?
By answering these and other questions, Swiggy can gain a better understanding of its users and their needs. This knowledge can then be used to improve the Swiggy experience for everyone.
